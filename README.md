**"Adaptive Kernel Bayes Filter"**  
Xin Liu, 2025

## 🔍 Description

The Adaptive Kernel Bayes Filter (AKBF) is a novel Bayesian filtering method that combines kernel Bayes rule with explicit dynamical models. It uses kernel mean embeddings to represent distributions in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), allowing for efficient nonlinear state estimation in high-dimensional systems.

This implementation demonstrates how AKBF approximates the prior and posterior of hidden states in real time, without requiring any offline training.
